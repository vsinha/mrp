Be sure to compile and fix any errors when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
Error Handling: Return errors explicitly; prefer wrapping with context
Naming: Use Go conventions (CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported)
When something doesn't work, debug and fix it - don't start over with a simple version
