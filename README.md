TODO

- convert all the test boms and mock names to be as if we're NASA building saturn 5 rockets, not spacex naming.
- make a way to specify the inputs as a few csv files
- make a CLI interface where we can specify inputs and run the mrp engine
- add functionality to generate a report card summary for each mrp run, including how many parts we created
- add functionality to identify the critical path
